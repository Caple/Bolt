#What is Bolt?
Bolt is an all-in-one Java web application server. It's aim is to make building, deploying, and maintaining real-time web applications easy as pie. It uses HTML5 technology behind the scenes to allow for easy remote method calling (server to client and vice versa). Bolt contains an embeded web, servlet, and database engine, so you don't need to install anything else. Drop the jar into a folder and run the server, or drop the jar into a new Java project and start coding a web app.

#### Features

* easy remote method calls using annotations
* built-in git integration for easy deployment
* web server built using embedded Jetty (super fast and reliable)
* embedded object database for easy persistence of POJOs
* open source, non-GPL (no copyleft)
* server is 100% Java (portable, platform independent)
* simple client spec (your desktop/mobile apps could communicate the same way your website does)

#### Downsides

* single developer (no support, limited updates/fixes)
* eats port 80, don't try to run another web server
* HTML5, not compatible with old browsers
